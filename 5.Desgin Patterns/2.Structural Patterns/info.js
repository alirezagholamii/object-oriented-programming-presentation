/*
Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and
classes into larger structures, while keeping this sturactures
flexible and efficient.

As the name implies, these patterns are concerned with object
 relationships and the structuring of the class or objects.
  They help in adding new functionality without having to
  modify the entire system. They ensure that if one part of a system changes,
   the whole system does not change with it.

The structural patterns we will cover in this chapter include:

Decorator Pattern

Facade Pattern

Adapter Pattern

Bridge Pattern

Composite Pattern

Flyweight Pattern

Proxy Pattern
